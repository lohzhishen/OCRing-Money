In this notebook, I attempt to create a computer vision pipeline to OCR the serial number of $2, $5, $10 and $50 Singapore notes. Each note has its serial number printed in 2 different places:

1. the bottom left corner - horizontally printed
2. the right side of the image - vertically printed

I will be OCR'ing the vertical serial number as I deem it to be more challenging then the other as tesseract works better OCR'ing horizontally printed words.
